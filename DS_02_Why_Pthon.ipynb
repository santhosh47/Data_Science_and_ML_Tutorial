        "## Spyder \n",
        "Scientific Python Development Environment (Spyder) is an open-source, cross-platform IDE for Data Science. The IDEs essential building blocks, include advanced editing, code analytical tools, IPython Console, variable explorer, plots, debugger and the help icon, which makes Spyder an ideal choice for data scientists.\n",
        "\n",
        "## JupyterLabs\n",
        "JupyterLab is an open-source web application, which has been designed to provide a user interface based on Jupyter Notebook. It allows the user to work with documents on Jupyter Notebook, born out of IPython in 2014. Its flexible interface lets users configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design allows for extensions that expand and enrich functionality. The application is easy to use, has an interactive data science interface, and is user-friendly for presentation or educational tools. \n",
        "\n",
        "## PyCharm\n",
        "PyCharm is an IDE for professional developers and data scientists. It has intelligent coding assistance that allows for smart code completion, code inspections, on-the-fly error highlighting and quick fixes, along with automated code refactorings and rich navigation capabilities. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Visual Studio Code\n",
        "VS Code is one of the most used Python IDEs. The IDE is known for its tools such as IntelliSense that allows features beyond syntax highlighting and smart completions based on variable types, imported modules, and functions definition. In addition, VS Code allows debugging code right from the editor with breakpoints, call stacks and an interactive console. Furthermore, VS Code is extensible and customisable, allowing for the addition of new languages, themes, and debuggers. The IDE also has built-in Git commands. \n",
        "\n",
        "## What do Experts suggest? \n",
        "According to Chief Data Scientist at PayU Finance, Piyush Gupta, “At PayU, the developers tend to choose the platform of their own choice for development. However, the majority of them use a combination of Jupyter Notebooks and PyCharm. Jupyter is great for initial EDA and provides flexibility for a lot of basic tasks. Personally, I prefer to use PyCharm because of better environment management, more accurate refactoring, better package management, a dedicated python console, better navigation & UX, and advanced debugging capabilities.”\n",
        "\n",
        "## What do I prefer for Beginners?\n",
        "For me the best learning tool for a beginner would always be google colab. I know it might lack some of the interesting features of a full fledged IDE. But its free and you dont need heavy machinery to load it.\n",
        "\n",
